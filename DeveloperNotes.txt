PURPOSE OF CHANGE:
Add an optional Notes field to the Assignment model to support user-supplied context that is not captured in the Title or Description. This supports stakeholder need for metadata without altering the core feature.

---
SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
- Added string? Notes property to Assignment model with private setter
- Updated constructor to allow optional Notes input
- Added Update() method for encapsulated field updates
- Updated AssignmentService to use Update() for changes
- Added AssignmentDto to API controller for safe binding
- Console app updated to display Notes
- Formatter updated to print Notes
- API and Swagger display Notes correctly
- All test classes updated with coverage for Notes

---
TDD PROCESS USED:
- Wrote failing unit test to confirm Notes can be stored
- Implemented Notes property and constructor support
- Refactored code for encapsulation and consistency
- Added integration test to validate Notes via API
- All tests run and passed after each step

---
CHALLENGES OR DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Had to implement AssignmentDto to support binding due to private setters
- Ensured constructor and Update method support consistent encapsulated changes
- Rewrote failing tests to align with new model constraints

---
NEXT STEPS OR RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add field validation for Notes (e.g., max length)
- Add front-end or CLI interactivity to input and edit Notes
- Add tests for edge cases like null, empty, and large Notes
