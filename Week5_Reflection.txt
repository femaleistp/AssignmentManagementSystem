## Week 5 Lab Reflection

Prompt: "What was different about working with HTTP vs. the console?"

My response:  Working with the API had many more layers involved, while more 
complex at the same time separation of concerns was more apparent. The console 
was a single layer of input and output, while the API had multiple layers of 
abstraction. The API also required more setup and configuration, which made 
it more complex to work with. However, the API also provided more functionality 
and flexibility, which made it more powerful in the long run.
